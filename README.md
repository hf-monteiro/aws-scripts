# Scripts Repository

Welcome to our Scripts Repository! This repository is a curated collection of scripts designed to automate various tasks, ranging from system administration to data processing. Each script is stored in its own folder, complete with a detailed README explaining its purpose, setup, and usage instructions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a unique script or tool. Here is the structure you can expect:

```bash
/aws-scripts
/example-script1
example-script1.py
README.md
/example-script2
example-script2.sh
README.md
/example-script3
example-script3.ipynb
README.md
```


Each script's folder contains:
- The script file(s) (.py, .sh, .ipynb, etc.)
- A `README.md` file with detailed instructions on how to use the script, including prerequisites, installation steps, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips.
